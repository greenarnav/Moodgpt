# Google Sign-In Fix for MoodGPT

## Problem
Your app is experiencing a "No such module 'GoogleSignIn'" error, indicating that the Google Sign-In SDK is missing from your project.

## Solution
We've created a temporary fix that allows your app to compile and run without the Google Sign-In SDK, along with instructions for properly installing it.

## Files Modified/Added

1. **Temporary Files**:
   - `Views/Onboarding/OnboardingViewTempFix.swift`: A version of OnboardingView that works without GoogleSignIn
   - `Services/GoogleAuthService.swift`: A placeholder implementation that doesn't require the GoogleSignIn SDK

2. **Installation Files**:
   - `GoogleSignInInstallation.md`: Detailed instructions for adding the GoogleSignIn SDK
   - `fix_google_signin.sh`: A script that fixes your project and sets up the necessary files
   - `Package.swift`: A Swift Package Manager file for adding GoogleSignIn

3. **Supporting Models**:
   - `Models/UserProfile.swift`: Updated to ensure compatibility with the temporary solution

## How to Use This Fix

1. Run the fix script to set up the project:
   ```bash
   ./fix_google_signin.sh
   ```

2. Follow the instructions provided in the terminal and in the `GoogleSignInInstallation.md` file.

3. After installing the GoogleSignIn SDK using Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods, you can:
   - Uncomment the GoogleSignIn imports and related code
   - Delete the temporary files as they'll no longer be needed

## Technical Details

The temporary fix works by:

1. **Commenting out** GoogleSignIn imports and related code
2. **Providing placeholders** for Google authentication functionality
3. **Using alerts** to inform users that Google Sign-In is being set up
4. **Setting up** the proper package dependencies structure

Once you install the actual GoogleSignIn SDK, you can revert to the original implementation by uncommenting the code or replacing the placeholder files with their original versions.
