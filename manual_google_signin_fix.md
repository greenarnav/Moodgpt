# Manual Fix for Google Sign-In Integration

Since CocoaPods installation is encountering issues, here's a manual approach to resolve the "No such module 'GoogleSignIn'" error:

## 1. Add Google Sign-In as a Swift Package (using Xcode directly)

1. Open your project in Xcode:
   ```
   open /Users/test/Desktop/newnew/Moodgpt/Moodgpt.xcodeproj
   ```

2. In Xcode, go to File > Add Packages...

3. In the search field at the top right, paste this URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS
   ```

4. Click "Add Package" and select both "GoogleSignIn" and "GoogleSignInSwift" libraries

## 2. Add a Stub GoogleSignIn Module (If Swift Package Manager fails)

If the above method doesn't work, you can create stub versions of the required files to make your app compile:

1. The temporary files have already been created:
   - `Moodgpt/Services/GoogleAuthService.swift` (placeholder version)
   - `Views/Onboarding/OnboardingViewTempFix.swift` (modified without GoogleSignIn imports)

2. These files implement temporary stubs that show alerts instead of actual Google Sign-In functionality.

3. The placeholder implementation allows the app to compile and run without the real GoogleSignIn module.

## 3. Update Your Code for the Workaround

1. Make sure you're using the temporary versions of the files by copying them to their actual locations:
   ```
   cp /Users/test/Desktop/newnew/Moodgpt/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingViewTempFix.swift /Users/test/Desktop/newnew/Moodgpt/Moodgpt/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift
   ```

2. This enables your app to compile and run with stub implementations, showing a "Google Sign-In is currently being set up" message when users try to use the feature.

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

Once you're able to install CocoaPods or add the Swift Package correctly:

1. Follow the implementation instructions in `cocoapods_implementation.md`
2. Update `GoogleAuthService.swift` and uncomment the GoogleSignIn imports
3. Make sure your Info.plist has the correct URL scheme configurations

## Installing CocoaPods

If you want to try installing CocoaPods again later:

1. Install Homebrew (package manager for macOS):
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install CocoaPods using Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install cocoapods
   ```

3. Then run:
   ```
   pod install
   ```
